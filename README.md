# Kwon-et-al-EC-Ag-presentation-scRNA-seq
The raw and consolidated codes for data analysis. All notebooks are named based on the sequence in which they were used, where the June notebooks are used in the later stages of the data analysis. 

## Raw codes

All raw codes are provided in the form of Rmarkdown notebooks ordered by the sequence in which they were used. 
The sequences were re-aligned using cellranger v8.0.1. and the script is provided inside the consolidated folder.

## Consolidated

The raw codes do not necessarily run in linear fashion and there were different possible annotation strategies involved.
Considering this, the consolidated codes is meant to provide an overview of how the raw data was processed and analyzed to give rise 
to whatever presented in the paper, disregarding any previous unendorsed versions.
